# User Management Dashboard

This project is a **User Management Dashboard** that allows users to manage a list of users with features to **add**, **edit**, **delete**, and **view** users. The users are fetched from a remote API (JSONPlaceholder) for realistic simulation.

- **Add User**: Allows you to add a new user to the list with the specified details.
- **Edit User**: Modify the details of an existing user.
- **Delete User**: Remove a user from the list.
- **Toast Notifications**: Real-time notifications for actions like adding, editing, and deleting users.
